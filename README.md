# Day 8 of learning JavaScript
- Today I learned about scope and closure.

## Lexical scoping
- Lexical scoping is the rule that decides variable access based on the function’s position in the code. 
- Because of this Inner functions can access variables of their outer functions.

## Closure 
- A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even after the outer function has executed.

----------
**Closure is possible because of lexical scoping, as lexical scoping decides which function can access what, and closure preserves that access after execution.**
